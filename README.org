** Installation
Install it from [[https://pypi.org/project/Fiume/][pip]]:

*** Configuration directories/files

When installed, ~fiume~ creates a ~.fiume~ directory in your home. 

It will contain a file, ~downloading.json~, which stores the torrents currently in download. You can modify this file freely and in any moment with your own tools, but if you want no trouble ~fiume~ provides a CLI command ~fiume-add~ to safely add new torrents.
