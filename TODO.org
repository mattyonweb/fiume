* Urgent
** Deal with scenario: peer does not send BITFIELD
** Poll every 900sec each tracker for new peers
** Better re-distribuition algorithm

* Not-so-urgent
** Implement rarest-first download strategy

** Magnet Links

** Table with TTL for peers
Avoid immediate reconnection attempts after a disconnection/failed connection. 
** Implements DHT

** Implement Fast Extension BEP 6

** Reduce the flooding when asking for data to Master
Instead of asking the master to send a piece through a queue (bear in mind that pieces can be even in the order of magnitude of a megabyte), the master sends the lock for file-reading and each PeerManager acquires and releases this lock autonomously.

The cons of this method is the usual one: if a PeerManager fails to release the lock, the whole program gets deadlocked. Maybe a timer could help (after all, reading 1MB of data from file does not take much)

* Not-at-all-urgent
** WRite in README infos about .fiume folder
